***Description***
This repository contains Python scripts for preprocessing HTML data using the Unstructured API and various utility functions to manage environment variables and file uploads. The main components include:

preprocessing.py: This script partitions HTML content into structured data using the Unstructured API, converts these elements into JSON format, and prints the output.
Utils.py: Contains utility functions for retrieving API keys and URLs from environment variables, and managing file uploads through a web interface.
Installation
To run these scripts, you'll need Python 3.x and the packages listed in requirements.txt. Install the dependencies with the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Preprocessing
To preprocess HTML files:

Ensure you have your .env file set up with the necessary DLAI_API_KEY and DLAI_API_URL.
Run the preprocessing.py script. This will read an HTML file, extract and process the data, and print the JSON output.
Utilities
The Utils.py file includes classes for environment management and file handling:

get_dlai_api_key(): Retrieves the DLAI API key from the environment.
get_dlai_url(): Retrieves the DLAI URL from the environment.
upld_file(): Manages file uploads through a Panel widget.
